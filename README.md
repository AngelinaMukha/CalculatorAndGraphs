All functions are possible with both fractional numbers and integers. Also, the translation of numbers into binary, decimal, octal and hexadecimal systems.The second tab is a graph on which functions can be displayed (in a color chosen by the user), which you will enter in the column of functions. If the function is written correctly, then when you click on the "ok" button, the function will be highlighted in green, otherwise it will be red. The program is capable of displaying linear functions, quadratic functions and cubic functions.The graphics are made on swing, which complicates the task more, but at the same time covers all the most important topics in swing, which is good for learning it.
